QHexEdit is a binary editor widget.
QHexEdit is a hex editor widget written in C++ for the Qt (Qt4) framework.
It is a simple editor for binary data, just like QPlainTextEdit is for text data.
QHexEdit inherits the functionality of QScrollArea.

QHexEdit takes the data of a QByteArray (setData()) and shows it to you.
You can use the mouse or the keyboard to navigate inside the widget. If you hit
the keys (0..9, a..f) you will change the data. Changed data is highlighted and
can be accessed via data().

There are some limitations: no inserting, only overwriting is supported. The size
of data has to be below 10 megabytes, otherwise the scroll sliders ard not shown.
Copy and paste functionality is also a subject of a later release.
